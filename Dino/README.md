## Usage
Download the software package from nand2tetris (https://www.nand2tetris.org/software)
Also download all the .jack files from this directory, to a single directory of your choice. Then, cmd into the tools folder of the software package and run 'JackCompiler PATH_TO_DIRECTORY'
with PATH_TO_DIRECTORY being the absolute or relative path to the directory that you stored the .jack files. Then, in the VMEmulator, choose to open files, and select the entire directory where the .jack and .vm files reside. Finally, switch 'Animate' to 'No Animation' and click run.

## How to Play
The goal of the game is to run as far as possible without crashing into cacti or pterodactyls. Use space bar or up arrow keys to jump, down arrow to crouch (and exit from a jump), and q to quit.
Note: obstacle placement is generated mostly randomly, so there are some maps that are impossible to progress in; in this case, simply restart for a new random layout.
